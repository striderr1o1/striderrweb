## First Exposure
My first exposure to computer programming was when I was in eighth grade. My father introduced me to CS50 by Harvard University. I remember typing some crazy stuff in the command line to compile my C code. Anyways, I quit after a few days.

## School Days
If my memory serves me right, my second exposure was in tenth grade. We had some C programming in our syllabus. I remember writing simple programs in C on Dev C++. I really enjoyed it. I think, it was then, that I really started to think of higher education in computer science.

## After Enrolling in CS Program
Fast forward to the summer before joining undergraduate program, I had already explored some python, a bit of data science, watched some of CS50 and also completed one or two cs50 assignments in C. So you can say that I was not completely new to programming. This prior experience in programming helped alot, primarily in the first semester. And another good decision was to not do assignments using AI tools like chatgpt. Yes, I did assignments using my bare hands. I didn't use chatgpt to copy paste, but I used it to learn (although, I've dropped that pov, but ok). If I had copied and pasted code using LLMs, I probably would be a loser in programming right now.

First semester, we covered fundamentals of C++, plus some HTML, CSS and JS. Second semester, we did OOP. In the winter and summer breaks, I discovered more about web development, primarily HTML, CSS and JS. And it was in summer, that I dived deep into HTML and CSS. Additionally, I enrolled in a Generative AI training. I might not be exaggerating if say that I spent a good amount of my time in summer learning how to code. I’d say, it was worth it. Especially, talking about the Gen AI training, where learned about RAG, Agentic AI, LLM apps and crazy stuff that's in the hype right now, it gave me quite an idea of this domain. And right now, Its been one month into the third semester and I've decided to focus on Data structures and algorithms. It seems to be important right now.

## Ending words…
If you've read this far, thanks. This was my journey into programming and tech in-general. If you have something to share about your journey or if you want to discuss something tech-related, DM me on linkedin so that we can discuss.
