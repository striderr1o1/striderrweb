My name is Mustafa Noman. I am a Muslim, a Pakistani and a student of Computer science. Other than that, I am good at playing certain sports like Football, Cricket and Swimming. My technical journey started unofficially when I was in 8th grade and officially after Intermediate(High school) studies.
Since then, I have been writing programs in C++, JavaScript and Python. I have experience with making AI applications around RAG and LangGraph. I have also explored Front-end Development in HTML, CSS and JS. My projects are available on my GitHub. And this much knowledge about me as a person is sufficient. If you want to know more about me, DM me on my linkedin and we can have a detailed chat.
